# ShopeSE-Ecommerce-Website

ShopSe is an user-friendly Full-Stack Website where the frontend and the backend is designed using NextJs,
MongoDB as database, clerk is used for authentication, shadcn ui is used for some good looking interface,
lucide-react for icons and stripe as the payment gateway. I developed both admin side and customer side
for ShopeSe. Admin can track the income, manage products, collections, orders and customers. While
on the client side we have wish-list and cart, client can browse through different products, collections and
purchase the items easily.
